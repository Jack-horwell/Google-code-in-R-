1) The program uses the "read.csv()" function to get the data from a csv file and then the "data.frame()" function converts
it into a data frame

2) The built-in function "head()" takes the first few observations from a given dataset

3) The variable "student" is used to store the data of five students. The function "data.frame()" allows variables to be easily
added when it is provided with a variable name and an array of content

4) The task of adding an extra column and adding data to the dataframe can be done simply in one line. The variable "student" is called
and the operator "$" specifies that we want to add data to the column that comes next, as we put "height" as the column and
it does not exist, it is created. We can then add data to this column using the "c()" function with five observations as this
is how many rows there are. The data frame can then be added to using the "rbind()" function, this allows us to specify a 
dataframe and add an observation to it

5) The built in function "write.csv()" allows a data frame to be named and a name for the csv file. A csv file is then created
in the same area as the current workspace with the chosen name

6) The "read.csv()" function can be used to import a csv file from the internet, for example Github, and put it into a variable.
The "head()" function can also be used to get the first few entries and print them out
